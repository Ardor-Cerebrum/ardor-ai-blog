## Included Demo: fastapi-mcp-demo

This repository includes a demo project in the `fastapi-mcp-demo` folder, which demonstrates how to expose a FastAPI application as an AI-native service using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### What is `fastapi-mcp-demo`?
- A FastAPI app that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and exposes it as an MCP-compliant API.
- Shows how to integrate FastAPI with the [fastapi-mcp](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp) library.
- Includes a ready-to-run example and instructions for both web and CLI-based MCP clients.

### How to Run the Demo
1. **Navigate to the folder:**
   ```sh
   cd fastapi-mcp-demo
   ```
2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or see pyproject.toml for dependencies
   ```
   Or, manually install:
   ```sh
   pip install fastapi uvicorn fastapi-mcp pydantic
   ```
4. **Run the server:**
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
5. **Try it out:**
   - Open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for Swagger UI.
   - Access the MCP manifest at [http://localhost:8000/mcp](http://localhost:8000/mcp).
   - Calculate BMI: [http://localhost:8000/bmi?weight_kg=70&height_m=1.75](http://localhost:8000/bmi?weight_kg=70&height_m=1.75)
