## Development Environment

### Why `uv` Transforms Development

Traditional Python package management is slow and error-prone. `uv` brings Rust-level performance:

```bash
# Traditional workflow (slow)
pip install -r requirements.txt  # 30-120 seconds
python -m venv .venv             # 5-15 seconds
python script.py                # Manual activation required

# Modern workflow with uv (10-100x faster)
uv sync                          # 1-3 seconds
uv run script.py               # Instant execution with auto-venv
```

### Project Setup

```bash
# Initialize new agentic project
mkdir my-agentic-system && cd my-agentic-system
uv init --python '>=3.11'

# Add dependencies (optional - our core uses stdlib only)
uv add openai anthropic google-generativeai
uv add fastapi uvicorn  # For web deployment
uv add prometheus-client  # For monitoring
```

## Agent Implementation Examples

### Message Protocol (ACP-Compliant)

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any, Optional, Dict
from enum import Enum
import uuid

class MessageType(Enum):
    REQUEST = "request"
    RESPONSE = "response" 
    ERROR = "error"
    STATUS = "status"

class Message:
    """Enterprise-grade message structure following ACP standards"""
    def __init__(
        self,
        content: Any,
        msg_type: MessageType = MessageType.REQUEST,
        agent_id: str = None,
        correlation_id: str = None,
        metadata: Optional[Dict] = None
    ):
        self.content = content
        self.msg_type = msg_type
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.correlation_id = correlation_id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.metadata = metadata or {}
        self.timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
```

### Research Agent (Information Intelligence)

```python
class ResearchAgent(Agent):
    """Advanced research synthesis with multi-source intelligence"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="research_agent",
            description="Multi-source research and competitive intelligence"
        )
        self.data_sources = [
            "academic_databases", "news_apis", "social_listening",
            "patent_search", "regulatory_filings", "market_research"
        ]
    
    async def process(self, message: Message) -> Message:
        topic = message.content.get("topic")
        
        # Comprehensive research pipeline
        research_results = await self._comprehensive_analysis(topic)
        confidence_score = await self._calculate_confidence(research_results)
        
        # Structure enterprise-grade research brief
        research_brief = {
            "title": f"Strategic Intelligence: {topic}",
            "executive_summary": research_results["executive_summary"],
            "key_insights": research_results["key_insights"],
            "market_analysis": research_results["market_analysis"],
            "competitive_landscape": research_results["competitive_landscape"],
            "confidence_score": confidence_score,
            "methodology": "Multi-source synthesis with AI-powered analysis"
        }
        
        return Message(
            content=research_brief,
            msg_type=MessageType.RESPONSE,
            agent_id=self.name,
            correlation_id=message.correlation_id
        )
```

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Add to PATH: export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

**Issue: API rate limits with real AI models**
```bash
# Use simulation mode for development
unset OPENAI_API_KEY ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
uv run enhanced_demo.py  # Will run in simulation mode
```

**Issue: Memory usage on large workloads**
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
uv run enhanced_demo.py --monitor-resources
# Consider distributed deployment for high-volume production
```

### Performance Optimization

**For High-Volume Production:**
- Use async/await patterns for concurrent processing
- Implement request queuing and rate limiting
- Deploy on distributed infrastructure (Kubernetes)
- Monitor costs and optimize model selection

**For Development:**
- Use simulation mode to avoid API costs
- Cache results for repeated testing
- Use smaller test datasets
